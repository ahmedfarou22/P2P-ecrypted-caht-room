A peer-to-peer (P2P) chat system is a type of online communication platform that allows users to
connect and exchange messages directly with each other, rather than through a central server. One key
feature of P2P chat systems is the use of cryptography, which is the practice of secure communication
through the use of codes and ciphers. Cryptography is used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
authenticity of the messages exchanged between users, ensuring that they cannot be intercepted or
tampered with by third parties. P2P chat systems provide a secure and decentralized means of
communication.
